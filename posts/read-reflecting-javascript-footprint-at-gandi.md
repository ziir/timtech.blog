July 31th 2020 was my last day as [Lead Front-End Engineer](/about#i'm-looking-for-a-job) at [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net).
[As announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tpillard/status/1289276041261920261), I have spent my last few hours there writing an article to be published on [Gandi's blog](https://news.gandi.net): [Reflecting on our JavaScript footprint](https://news.gandi.net/en/2020/07/reflecting-on-our-javascript-footprint/).

After quickly describing the changes occuring on the Web, this article introduces the concept of **JavaScript footprint** by examining the architecture of two websites I have been working on at Gandi:
- https://www.gandi.net
- https://shop.gandi.net

This article contains insights on how Gandi is organized, develops websites, the difficulties that are met, as well as some leads and solutions towards solving these.

There's a lot of interesting topics, contents that, for the sake of brievety, and in order to meet a very tight deadline, did not make it into the article that I intend to develop on this blog, so stay tuned. :)
