As I'm getting close to my fifth month at [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com), I have given my second presentations to engineers within the Web Product Team.

The presentation aims to be a high-level introduction to **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**.
It covers the key concepts needed to approach CORS:
- Origin
- Same-Origin Policy
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- OPTIONS preflight requests

It also tells [the tale of a CORS twist in the context of a Chrome Web Extension](https://twitter.com/tpillard/status/1349669957764861952).
Finally, the presentation mentions [the quickly evolving web security landscape in a post-spectre world](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-post-spectre-webdev/).

This presentation is also kind of meant as a not so subtle invitation to:
- double-checking your cross-origin setup.
- being wary of relying on defaults implemented by browsers.
- not blindly trusting the specifications.

This presentation was given over video conference using screen sharing, in about 30 minutes excluding questions.
