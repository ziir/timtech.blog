## Some Projects

### [soundcut/app](https://github.com/soundcut/app)

[Soundcut (beta)](https://www.soundcut.pw) is a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) which enables you to extract, share, save, download or simply listen to specific moments (a slice or cut) of a song or any audio source.
Built using JavaScript (ES2017) with [hyper/viperHTML](https://viperhtml.js.org/hyper.html) and a strong focus on performance, it leverages a SPA/SSR/SW/Shell Architecture.

### [soundcut/decode-audio-data-fast](https://github.com/soundcut/decode-audio-data-fast)

**decode-audio-data-fast** is a small JavaScript utility allowing to decode mp3 audio file data in the browser from a File/Blob into a AudioBuffer using [AudioContext.decodeAudioData()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/decodeAudioData), but consistently faster than the native method.
